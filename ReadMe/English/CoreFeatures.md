# Documentation
This documentation introduces the usage and features of HintServiceMeow.
## Hint
Hint is a primary feature that allows you to add text to a specific position on a player's screen. The following example adds text to the lower left side of the player's screen.
```Csharp
 Hint hint = new Hint
 {
     Text = "Hello World",
     FontSize = 40,
     YCoordinate = 700,
     Alignment = HintAlignment.Left
 };

 PlayerDisplay playerDisplay = PlayerDisplay.Get(player);
 playerDisplay.AddHint(hint);
```
Since HSM has an auto-update feature, any changes to a property (like Text, FontSize, Alignment, etc.) will automatically reflect on the player's screen without any further method calls.
```Csharp
hint.Text = "Some New Text";
// You do not have to call any method after updating properties
``` 
#### Properties
| Properties | Description |
| - | - |
| Guid (Readonly) | A generated Guid for the hint |
| Id | A custom string id |
| SyncSpeed | The priority of hint's update. The faster it is, the faster it will be updated after the content is updated |
| FontSize | The size of the text |
| LineHeight | The extra space between each line of text |
| Content | The content of the hint. The text displayed will be obtained from this property. |
| Text | Setting this property will overwrite Content with static text. |
| AutoText | Setting this property will overwrite Content with a string delegate. |
| Hide | Whether to hide this hint or not |
| XCoordinate | The horizontal position of the text. The higher the X coordinate is, the righter the text will be displayed |
| YCoordinate | The vertical position of the text. The higher the Y coordinate is, the lower the text will be displayed ![The position of Y coordinate](Images/YCoordinateExample.jpg) |
| Alignment | The alignment of the text. |
| YCoordinateAlign | The alignment of text to y coordinate. For example, Top means that the y coordinate represents the top of the text |
## DynamicHint
Dynamic hints allow you to display text without specifying a fixed position. Dynamic hints are automatically positioned on the screen in areas where they wonâ€™t overlap with other text elements, ensuring optimal readability. The following example adds text to the player's screen without setting a fixed position.
```CSharp
var dynamicHint = new DynamicHint
{
    Text = "Hello Dynamic Hint"
};

PlayerDisplay playerDisplay = PlayerDisplay.Get(player);
playerDisplay.AddHint(dynamicHint);
```
#### Properties
| Properties | Description |
| - | - |
| Guid (Readonly) | A generated Guid for the hint |
| Id | A custom string id |
| SyncSpeed | The priority of hint's update. The faster it is, the faster it will be updated after the content is updated |
| FontSize | The size of the text |
| LineHeight | The extra space between each line of text |
| Content | The content of the hint. The text displayed in Hint will be obtained from this property. |
| Text | Setting this property will overwrite content with static text. |
| AutoText | Setting this property will overwrite content with a string delegate. |
| Hide | Whether to hide this hint or not |
| TopBoundary, BottomBoundary, LeftBoundary, RightBoundary | The boundary for dynamic hint to arrange its text |
| TargetX, TargetY | The dynamic hint will try to move toward these coordinates, but the final placement depends on available space. |
| TopMargin, BottomMargin, LeftMargin, RightMargin | The extra space the hint will add to its surroundings when arranging |
| Priority | The priority of dynamic hint. The higher the priority, the former it will be arranged |
| Strategy | The strategy dynamic hint will be used when arranging |
## CommonHint
CommonHint is a component that allows you to display text in a preset position. The following example uses CommonHint to display multiple messages to the player.
```CSharp
var ui = PlayerUI.Get(player);
ui.CommonHint.ShowRoleHint("SCP173", new[] { "Kill all humans", "Use your skills" });
ui.CommonHint.ShowMapHint("Heavy Containment Zone", "The place where most SCPs spawn");
ui.CommonHint.ShowItemHint("Keycard", "Used to open doors");
ui.CommonHint.ShowOtherHint("The server is starting!");
```
